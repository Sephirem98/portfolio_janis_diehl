### About
---
This programm is my version of the code.golf challenge [Diamonds](https://code.golf/diamonds) written in the esotheric programming language brainfuck. <br>
It displays nine diamonds made up of numbers in the following pattern: 
```
         1

         1
        121
         1

        ...

         1
        121
       12321
      1234321
     123454321
    12345654321
   1234567654321
  123456787654321
 12345678987654321
  123456787654321
   1234567654321
    12345654321
     123454321
      1234321
       12321

### What is brainfuck
---
Brainfuck is a turing-complete [esotheric programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language).<br>
The language uses only eight commands and is based on a one-dimensional array, with each cell initialized to zero.<br>
By using the commands '<' and '>' you can move the data pointer along the cells.<br>
With '+' and '-' you can increment or decrement the value of the current cell.<br>
You can create loops by using '[' and ']', output the current cell value with '.' and get a one byte input using ',' .

### Getting started 
---
To run the code you can either use an [online debugger](https://minond.xyz/brainfuck/) , an [online interpreter](https://gc.de/gc/brainfuck/) or download an [interpreter](https://github.com/pocmo/Python-Brainfuck).

### Usage
---
Just put the source code into an online interpreter or open the source file with a local interpreter and run it.
